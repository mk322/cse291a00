    "Q: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?\nA: Since Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting, she earns $12 / 60 = $0.2 per minute. Working 50 minutes, she earned $0.2 x 50 = $10. The answer is 10.\n\n",
    "Q: Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?\nA: In the beginning, Betty has only half of the money she needs, which is 100 / 2 = $50. Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, so they gave her 15 * 2 = $30. Now that she got $15 from her parents and $30 from her grandparents, she will need $100 - $15 - $30 = $55. Since she already has $50, she needs $55 - $50 = $5 more. The answer is 5.\n\n",
    "Q: Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?\nA: Julie read twice as many pages as yesterday, so she read 12 * 2 = 24 pages today. Since yesterday, Julie read 12 + 24 = 36 pages. So, there are 120 - 36 = 84 pages left to be read. Since she wants to read half of the remaining pages, she should read 84 / 2 = 42 pages. The answer is 42.\n\n",
    "Q: James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so he writes 12 * 52 = 624 pages a year. The answer is 624.\n\n",
    "Q: Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?\nA: There are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers, so there are 10 * 1.8 = 18 purple flowers. Because there are 10 yellow flowers, so there are 10 + 18 = 28 yellow and purple flowers. There are 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers, so there are 28 * 0.25 = 7 green flowers. In summary, he has 10 + 18 + 7 = 35 flowers in his garden. The answer is 35.\n\n",
    "Q: Albert is wondering how much pizza he can eat in one day. He buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices.

There are 32 slices from the large pizzas and 16 slices from the small pizzas, so he eats 32 + 16 = 48 pieces that day. The answer is 48.\n\n",
    "Q: Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school. Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds. Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans. And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?\nA: Ken poured jelly beans into the box until the weight was 2 pounds, so the weight of the box was 2 pounds at first. Then Ken added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple, so the weight of the box was 2 * 3 = 6 pounds. After Ken added another 2 pounds of jelly beans, the weight of the box was 6 + 2 = 8 pounds. Finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again, so the weight of the box was 8 * 2 = 16 pounds. The answer is 16.\n\n",
    "Q: Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?\nA: Alexis spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt, so she spent 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = $143 on everything else. Alexis had a budget of $200 and finally there was $16 left, so she spent 200 - 16 = $184 in total. Since Alexis has spent $143 on everything else, she spent 184 - 143 = $41 on the shoes. The answer is 41.\n\n",
    "Q: Tina makes $18.00 an hour. If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage. If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?\nA: Tina makes $18.00 an hour, so she makes 18 * 8 = $144.00 in an 8-hour shift. Tina works 10 hours every day for 5 days, so she works 10 * 5 = 50 hours. Since she works 8 hours every day, she gets 50 - 8 * 5 = 10 hours of overtime. Her hourly overtime wage is 18 + 18 / 2 = $27.00. Tina works 10 hours a day, and 8 hours of that is paid at her regular hourly wage, so she makes 10 - 8 = 2 hours of overtime every day. Since her hourly overtime wage is $27.00, she makes 27 * 2 = $54.00 in overtime each day. Every day, tina makes $144.00 in an 8-hour shift and $54.00 in overtime, so she makes 144 + 54 = $198.00 each day. Tina works 5 days a week, so she makes 198 * 5 = $990.00. The answer is 990.\n\n"
