When the original question is answerable, please start the subquestion with \"Now we can answer the question: \".\n\nQuestion 1: Four years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed. If Mohamed is currently twice as 30 years old, how old is Kody?\nQuestion 1.1: How old is Mohamed?\nAnswer 1.1: He is currently 30 * 2 = 60 years old. The answer is 60.\nQuestion 1.2: How old was Mohamed four years ago?\nAnswer 1.2: Four years ago, he must have been 60 - 4 = 56 years old. The answer is 56.\nQuestion 1.3: How old was Kody four years ago?\nAnswer 1.3: Kody was half as old as Mohamed four years ago. Thus, Kody was 56 / 2 = 28 years old. The answer is 28.\nQuestion 1.4: Now we can answer the question: How old is Kody?\nAnswer 1.4: She is currently 28 + 4 = 32 years old. The answer is 32.\n\nQuestion 2: On a moonless night, three fireflies danced in the evening breeze. They were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies before two of the fireflies flew away. How many fireflies remained?\nQuestion 2.1: How many fireflies joined?\nAnswer 2.1: The fireflies were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies, which are 12 - 4 = 8 fireflies. The answer is 8.\nQuestion 2.2: Now we can answer the question: How many fireflies remained?\nAnswer 2.2: Three fireflies were dancing originally. They were joined by 8 fireflies before two of them flew away. So there were 3 + 8 - 2 = 9 remaining. The answer is 9.\n\n",
